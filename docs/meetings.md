# Meeting of October 13, 2025

Before this first meeting, we all reviewed the project topic. We mainly discussed each person’s skills and preferences in order to reach a mutually agreed task distribution. We concluded that:

- **Martin NERON** and **Evan LEMONNIER** would develop the backend  
- **Matis DUBOIS** and **Matthieu CHARTON** would develop the frontend  
- **Lucas MAGRET** and **Melissa GHAOUI** would manage the database and probably the testing

We then talked about the technologies to use, and we agreed on:
- Spring for the backend
- Angular for the frontend
- Firebase for authentication and notifications
- A standard database, most likely MySQL

We then agreed that for the next meeting, each of us should prepare around 5 functional requirements.

# Meeting of Monday, October 20, 2025

We shared the functional requirements for the project and discussed which ones to keep or remove. This may evolve in the future. We then planned the project modeling phase and reached the following distribution:

- **Database model**: Lucas MAGRET and Melissa GHAOUI (since they will manage the database)
- **Interface mockups**: Matis DUBOIS and Matthieu CHARTON (same logic since they will manage the frontend)
- **UML diagrams including use cases**: Martin NERON and Evan LEMONNIER

We don't necessarily need to be finished by the next meeting (**October 27, 2025**), but we should have made good progress.
