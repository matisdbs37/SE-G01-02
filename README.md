By providing essential information, you make it easier to follow your development process and assess the quality of your project.
> 
> Maintaining a well-organized document reflects good project management practices and promotes transparency, collaboration, and accountability within your team. It simplifies the understanding of your project’s scope, goals, and challenges, benefiting not only your team but also anyone who reviews your work.

## Project Description

This project is the result of teamwork as part of the project assignment for the [Software Engineering](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/predmet/proinz) course at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb.

Briefly describe the goal of your project. What motivated you? What problem are you solving?

> Since this is a part of course assigment, also mention what new things you want/have learned.
> 
> A well-written description allows you to showcase your work to other developers, as well as potential employers. Not only does the first impression on the description page often distinguish a good project from a bad one, but it also represents good practice that you must master.

# 📝 Code of Conduct [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
As students, you are surely familiar with the minimum acceptable behavior defined in the **STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT** of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, as well as additional guidelines for teamwork in the Software Engineering course.

We expect you to follow the **[IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html)**, which plays an important educational role in setting the highest standards of integrity, responsible behavior, and ethical conduct in professional activities. By doing so, the professional community of software engineers defines general principles that establish moral character, guide important business decisions, and set clear moral expectations for all members of the community.

The Code of Conduct is a set of enforceable rules that serve to clearly communicate expectations and requirements for the community/team's work. It defines obligations, rights, unacceptable behaviors, and appropriate consequences (unlike the ethical code). In this repository, one of the widely accepted codes of conduct for working in open-source communities is provided.

> ### Improve Team Functionality:
> - Define how work will be distributed among team members.
> - Agree on how the team will communicate.
> - Don’t waste time on deciding how the group will resolve disputes—apply the standards!
> - It is implicitly assumed that all team members will follow the code of conduct.
> 
> ## Issue Reporting
> 
> The worst thing that can happen is for someone to remain silent when there are problems. There are several things you can do to best resolve conflicts and issues:
> 
> - Contact me directly via [e-mail](mailto:vlado.sruk@fer.hr), and we will do everything we can to confidentially understand what steps we need to take to resolve the problem.
> - Talk to your assistant, as they have the best insight into the team dynamics. Together, you’ll figure out how to resolve the conflict and how to avoid further impact on your work.
> - If you feel comfortable, discuss the problem directly. Minor incidents should be resolved directly. Take time and privately speak with the affected team member and trust in their sincerity.
